#Assignment 
In this assignment I have tried to create two pages:
*update.php and delete.php -> The data can be edited and deleted easily
*And also fixed database connection and used localhost server.

#Update
*On clicking Update button a form will open 
*in which you can type the "Sno" i.e "Shoppingcartitemid"
*you can update Productname, 
*you can update Quantity 
*and Subtotal i.e "unitprice".

#Delete
*On clicking Delete Button you can easily delete particular row from database.


#Error
*Due to some technical errors the delete button is not working.
